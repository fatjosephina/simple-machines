# Pully Penelope (simple-machines)
Pully Penelope (repository: simple-machines) is a top-down action-adventure game in which the player character (Penelope) cannot attack, but only pull and push objects with handles. The player tries to collect treasure from a cave/dungeon and then escape with their life. However, there are also enemies which will try to steal Penelope’s treasure and pull her into traps or different rooms, hindering the player’s progress. Each cave/dungeon is divided into different rooms and sections.
